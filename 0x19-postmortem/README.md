## Postmortem: Outage on Simple Web Stack Project

## Issue Summary:
Duration: August 10, 2023, 14:30 - August 10, 2023, 17:45 (UTC)
Impact: The web application experienced intermittent downtime and slow response times. Users reported difficulty accessing the service. Approximately 30% of users were affected.

## Root Cause:
The root cause of the outage was a database connection leak in the application code. This caused the database connection pool to exhaust its resources, leading to connection timeouts and degraded performance.

## Timeline:
- **14:30:** Issue detected through a spike in error logs and monitoring alerts indicating increased response time.
- **14:45:** Engineering team initiated investigation after multiple alerts triggered.
- **15:00:** Assumption was made that the issue might be related to increased traffic due to a recent marketing campaign. Web server logs were analyzed to identify the source of the traffic.
- **15:30:** Increased traffic was ruled out as the cause. Focus shifted to the database layer due to noticeable delay in query execution.
- **16:00:** Misleading path: Initial suspicion was on the database server itself. Indexes and query performance were examined, but no significant issues were found.
- **16:30:** Misleading path: Network connectivity issues between web servers and the database were explored, but no abnormalities were identified.
- **17:00:** Issue escalated to senior database and backend engineers for further investigation.
- **17:30:** Database connection leak identified as the root cause, consuming all available connections over time.
- **17:45:** The issue was resolved by fixing the connection leak and optimizing the database connection pool configuration.

**Root Cause and Resolution:
The issue was caused by a mismanaged database connection handling in the application code. Connections were not being properly closed after usage, leading to a gradual buildup of open connections. This caused the database connection pool to become exhausted, resulting in timeouts and sluggish performance.

To resolve the issue, the following steps were taken:
- Identified and fixed the specific code sections responsible for the connection leak.
- Optimized the database connection pooling configuration to ensure efficient recycling of connections.
- Conducted thorough testing to verify that the issue was resolved without introducing new problems.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following measures will be implemented:
- Regular code reviews to ensure proper connection handling and resource cleanup.
- Improved monitoring and alerting for database connection usage and pool depletion.
- Implementation of automated tests specifically targeting connection leaks.
- Documentation updates to highlight best practices for database connection management.

## Tasks to Address the Issue:
1. Patch application code to close database connections after usage.
2. Review and update connection pooling configurations for optimal resource management.
3. Implement automated tests to check for connection leaks in the codebase.
4. Enhance monitoring and alerting mechanisms to promptly detect and address connection pool depletion.
5. Conduct training sessions for the development team on proper database connection management.

In conclusion, the outage was caused by a database connection leak in the application code, resulting in performance degradation and intermittent downtime. A series of misdirections during the investigation led to a delay in identifying the root cause. Once identified, the issue was promptly resolved by fixing the code and optimizing the connection pool. Corrective measures and preventative actions have been outlined to prevent similar incidents in the future and ensure the stability of the web application.
